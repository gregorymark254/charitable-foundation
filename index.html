            <h5>I know it's hard to believe people when they say, "I know how you feel". But actually I know how you feel.
                I understand feeling as small as insignificant as humanly as possible and how it can ache in places that you did not know you had inside you.
                You know, it doesn't matter the efforts you make trying to define yourself, how many times you try to keep both your struggles and life in perspective,
                you will go to bed every night going over every detail, wondering where you went wrong, and sometimes you can convince yourself that,
                things are going to get back to normal and after all that, however long that may be, you will meet people here that will make you feel worthwhile and the little pieces of your
                soul will finally come back and all that frustrated past will eventually begin to fade away. Just hold on ❤.</h5>

            <p><b>We can’t help everyone, but…Everyone can help someone.</b></p>
            <p>It's easy to run to others. It's so hard to stand on one's own record. You can fake virtue for an audience. You can't fake it in your own eyes. Your ego is your strictest judge.
                They run from it. They spend their lives running. It's easier to donate a few thousand to charity and think oneself noble than to base self-respect on personal standards of personal achievement.
                It's simple to seek substitutes for competence--such easy substitutes: love, charm, kindness, charity. But there is no substitute for competence.</p>

            <p><b>For it is in giving that we receive</b></p>
            <p>Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, you’ll find one at the end of your arm.
                As you grow older, you will discover that you have two hands: one for helping yourself, the other for helping others.
                There is no exercise better for the heart than reaching down and lifting people up.
                Your “good old days” are still ahead of you, may you have many of them.</p>

                If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope.” – Barack Obama</p>

            <p>The power of youth is the common wealth for the entire world. The faces of young people are the faces of our past,
                our present and our future. No segment in the society can match with the power, idealism, enthusiasm and courage of the young people.</p>
